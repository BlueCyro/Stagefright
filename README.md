# üí°üìΩÔ∏èüé¨ Stagefright: (tagline here)

Stagefright is a mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com) via [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) that adds ArtNet DMX support to Resonite!

Requires [ArtfullySimple](https://github.com/RileyGuy/ArtfullySimple) in your `rml_libs` folder to function.

# Installation
- Download the latest [ArtfullySimple](https://github.com/RileyGuy/ArtfullySimple) release and place it into `rml_libs`
- Place `Stagefright.dll` from the latest release of this repository into `rml_mods`


# Usage
Simply spawn out your favorite Developer Tool, click 'Create New' in your context menu, and choose one of the few self-explanatory options to set the stage(s) up for DMX input.

No additional setup after installation is required if you're simply using this mod to control a ready-built DMX stage in Resonite. If you're interested
in building your own stage, you can find instructions on how to make your own DMX stage and devices [here](STAGES.md)
